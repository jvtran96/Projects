</br>

</p>
Virtual Shaq can occupy one of six states, happy, sad, angry, hunger, sleepy, tired, or sated. There are multiple ways to alter Shaq's
state, either by petting, feeding, walking, or punishing him. By petting Shaq, he becomes happy, and if you continue to pet him, Shaq will
eventually get tired and then sleepy. Shaq won't wake up unless you take another course of action. Take Shaq for a walk and he will eventually
get tired and too hungry to continue on. Feed Shaq some food and he will be happy again and if you feed him some more he will feel sated. Shaq
is a very sensitive person however, he will feel sad as soon as he is punished. Punish him more and he will get angry. Adding on to Shaq's
sensitivity, if you leave him alone long enough, Shaq will either get angry with you or he will grow tired and fall asleep.
